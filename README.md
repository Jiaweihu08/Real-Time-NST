# Real-Time-NST

This personal project is done with an intent of implementing the "Learning by doing" strategy to improve my understanding on CNN, Style Transfer, Custumized training with TensorFlow 2.0, Transfer Learning, and coding skills in general.

It's split in two parts, the first one closely follows this tutorial from TensorFlow's website(see notebook for address) to perform Style Transfer on images by iterating the pixel values of the content image. The second part is dedicated to an intent of training a Image Transfor Network for stylization in real-time.
